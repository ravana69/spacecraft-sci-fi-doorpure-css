# Spacecraft SCI-FI Door - Pure CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/xxmyPJo](https://codepen.io/josetxu/pen/xxmyPJo).

First test of what I hope will be a series of 3D sci-fi spacecraft doors made in pure CSS.   

 - Click & Hold to open the door.  
 - Move the mouse to change the perspective angle.
